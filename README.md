ViSCAT (Video Shot-based Content Annotation Toolkit) is a toolkit for analyzing the content of social media videos developed in the CAT4SMR program. It is designed with the intent of being interoperable with [4CAT](https://github.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/4cat). Please note that this is a student-embedded project from the University of Amsterdam.
